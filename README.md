This was done for my high school computer science 12 final project.\
Model is an implementation of the StarGAN model in PyTorch Lightning from ![this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020) paper

Read about the training process [here](https://wandb.ai/stevan-zhuang/Image%20Domain%20Transfer%20GAN/reports/Computer-Science-12-Final-Project-StarGAN-Training--Vmlldzo1NTQ2MzY?accessToken=8x8r4lqay36gg8zmlz9zgd1k0awrx7lix0okl78re04wwvpadhn8d1trbi4za1a0).
